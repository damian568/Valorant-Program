    //Beginner
    <string name="beginner_s_guide">BEGINNER’S GUIDE</string>
    <string name="txt_beginner1">Straight from the files of Brimstone, this is the VALORANT Beginner’s Guide. Whether this is your first rotation or you\'re needing a refresher, we figure it’s best you take it from the Agent who’s seen it all before.\n \nBelow is what to know before your first game. Pay attention. Might learn something.</string>
    <string name="txt_beginner2">Before you enter your first round, you get to pick from a group of Agents, each with their own role and special skills designed to work alongside each other toward a win. You can dig into the specifics of each Agent on our Agents page.</string>
    <string name="txt_beginner3">After everyone selects their Agent (oh, you picked that one), you’ll jump into a random map and formally enter the first round.\n \nStart a round as either attacker or defender and switch sides in between. Before you do either, you’ll need to navigate the buy phase, which lets you purchase weapons and abilities. What you buy shapes how you can win. Let style or matchups guide your choices.</string>
    <string name="txt_beginner4">No one’s going to tell you how to spend your money, but you’re going to have to pull the trigger at some point.\n \nThere’s a gun for every situation and you can comb the details of each weapon on our dedicated arsenal page. When in doubt, try buying based on a weapon’s type and see how it fits your style, expertise, and your team’s strategy.</string>
    <string name="txt_beginner5">Each map is a different stage to style on your enemies. Flex your creative skills and savvy gunplay for different encounters.\n \nBelow are the basics and you can plot your route using our detailed maps page.</string>
    <string name="txt_beginner6">Yeah, you might already know how to frag an enemy six ways from Sunday, but Brimstone will tell you, most of those ways are pretty noisy.</string>
    <string name="txt_beginner7">No more doubts, you’re ready. But like you, we’re just getting started.\n \nWe’ll keep you updated on the latest Agents, Maps, and more on our news page. You can always keep in touch with us on social for everything else.</string>

    //Community Code
    <string name="txt_community_code">VALORANT COMMUNITY CODE</string>
    <string name="txt_community_code1">Before queueing up for your first match, we ask players to agree to the expectations outlined here. We encourage everyone to give the full document a read, and we hope this helps you calibrate on the community we look forward to building together in VALORANT. Please be aware that this Code of Conduct for VALORANT is supplemental to the Riot Games Terms of Service, which you must agree to before being allowed into any of our games.</string>
    <string name="txt_community_code2">VALUES</string>
    <string name="txt_community_code3">TRIUMPHANT THROUGH TEAMWORK</string>
    <string name="txt_community_code4">The best experiences in VALORANT come from teamwork. We believe that coordination with teammates is part of an individual’s expression of skill, and that everyone plays their best when they’re playing together. \n \nWe celebrate the teammate who clutches the round, but we recognize that these moments have the greatest impact when you’re working together to set each other up every round. We intend to deliver experiences, tools and content that enable teams to play cohesively, whether they’ve had five or five hundred rounds to get to know one another.</string>
    <string name="txt_community_code5">FAIRNESS IN EVERY MATCH</string>
    <string name="txt_community_code6">To have meaningful stakes in every match, the conditions for that match must be fair for all players. We believe that fairness means games are free from cheating, misuse of game systems, and all forms of harassment. \n \nWe aim to uphold competitive integrity, and to ensure that all players are treated with respect in our ecosystem. When addressing disruptive behavior, we believe that penalties should reflect the standards and needs of the community, and that they should address the specifics of the disruptive behaviour rather than being overly punitive.</string>
    <string name="txt_community_code7">A GAME WHERE PLAYERS THRIVE</string>
    <string name="txt_community_code8">It’s up to us to set the conditions for VALORANT that enable every player to play their best. That means ensuring safety, fairness, and agency over experiences on our platform. We strive to give players the tools they need to protect themselves and their account, and we trust them to use them to curate their experience. \n \nWe believe in giving players control over how they interact with their peers, and in providing meaningful options for exercising that control - options that don’t compromise their ability to compete and coordinate with their team. Even with many options, we intend to protect every player’s right to choose how they coordinate and to prevent players from being forced out of channels due to fear or abuse.</string>
    <string name="txt_community_code9">EXPECTATIONS</string>
    <string name="txt_community_code10">Every VALORANT player deserves an opportunity to be themselves and play their best. You deserve to be able to play each match free from harassment, hatred, and abuse; so do your teammates and your opponents. \n \nTo create a game that lives up to our values above, we need your help. When you play VALORANT, we both ask and expect you to commit to the following:</string>
    <string name="txt_community_code11">COMPETE TO WIN, TOGETHER</string>
    <string name="txt_community_code12">Teamwork wins games. Recognize that you can only win WITH teammates, not in spite of them.</string>
    <string name="txt_community_code13">For example, we expect and encourage you to: \n \n✓ Stay focused on strategy. If you can’t agree, pick something and commit. You’re better off working together on a questionable plan than not working together at all.\n✓ Leverage your team’s strengths and help cover their weaknesses. They’ll cover yours too!\n✓ Celebrate the plays of your teammates. You set them up, help them shine in the moment!\n✓ Bring your best self to every match. Everyone has bad games - we understand! But don’t queue up if you’re not in it to win.\n \n✗ Don’t give up on teammates, even if they’re having a bad game.\n✗ Never sabotage your team or try to ruin the game, even if you’re not having fun.\n✗ Please don’t tell teammates how they should be playing. If they’re open to it, constructive feedback is great! But don’t order people around, even if you’re frustrated.\n✗ Avoid spending more time arguing than collaborating. If you’re out for the round, focus on helping your team finish strong rather than arguing with them while they close it out.</string>
    <string name="txt_community_code14">COMMIT TO RESPECT AND EMPATHY</string>
    <string name="txt_community_code15">We ask that you treat others with dignity and respect. Exercise empathy and seek to build trust with teammates so that they can perform their best.</string>
    <string name="txt_community_code16">For example, we expect and encourage you to:\n\n✓ Obey the platinum rule - Treat others as they wish to be treated. If you don’t know, ask.\n✓ Respect individual differences and experiences. VALORANT is a global community.\n✓ Treat everyone like they can teach you something - they might just broaden your worldview.\n✓ Use spicy language with caution. If you’ve just met, don’t assume everyone will understand your meaning or intent. If someone asks you not to use a term, stop - even if you don’t think it’s offensive.\n✓ Communication channels are a shared space! Keep comms focused on coordination, even if you’re waiting to respawn.\n\n✗ Never use hateful or abusive language. We do not tolerate derogatory comments on any player\'s gender, race, sexual orientation, age, mental or physical abilities, religious affiliations, or country of origin.\n✗ Don’t make jokes about people. People aren’t punchlines.\n✗ Threats of any kind are unacceptable in VALORANT. Intent doesn’t matter here, and it’s on you to know your audience if you think it’s “just a joke.”\n✗ Don’t expect someone to “toughen up” over your language. If you upset someone, own it and do better next time. Respect people’s boundaries.\n✗ Avoid blasting comms channels with background noise, music, or spam.</string>
    <string name="txt_community_code17">PROTECT YOUR TEAM AND YOUR COMMUNITY</string>
    <string name="txt_community_code18">Build the community you want to play in, one match at a time. Use tools and good judgement to protect yourself and your peers, and support others when they need your help.</string>
    <string name="txt_community_code19">For example, we expect and encourage you to:\n\n✓ Use settings and systems to manage the experience you want to have. Opt out of communication channels you don’t want to be in. Turn on language filters, use mutes, and report behavior that isn’t okay.\n✓ If someone is harassing a teammate, speak up if you’re able. Take care not to make the situation worse, but sometimes a little support can mean a lot to your teammate.\n✓ Help keep games free from cheating or glitch abuse; if you think someone else is doing it, report it so we can take care of it.\n\n✗ Don’t call for mass reports or pull teammates into an argument. One report is enough to let us know something’s happening.\n✗ Don’t let someone bring you down to their level. If a player is harassing you, often it’s better to disengage than to “fire back.” It takes two to keep a fight going.</string>
    <string name="txt_community_code20">BE YOUR OWN LAST LINE OF DEFENSE</string>
    <string name="txt_community_code21">Help Riot keep you safe. Be responsible with your account, devices, personal information, and conduct.</string>
    <string name="txt_community_code22">For example, we expect and encourage you to:\n\n✓ Use strong passwords and keep all your devices secure.\n✓ Let us know as soon as possible if you think your account has been hacked.\n✓ Accounts have a one-person maximum. We expect you to keep your account secure and not to let anyone else use it. If you want to rank up, play with your friends; Don’t ask your friends to play for you.\n✓ Play responsibly. Practice self care so you can bring your best to every game you play.\n\n✗ Never run third-party programs that interfere with gameplay. We expect you to exercise caution and good judgment here.\n✗ Don’t share personal information with strangers. Also, don’t share anyone else’s information. We have a zero tolerance policy for doxxing on our platform.\n✗ Do not impersonate anyone. In particular, don’t impersonate Rioters or highly visible players.\n✗ Avoid queueing up for one more when you know you’re tilted. Take breaks, and recognize when you’re getting frustrated.</string>
    <string name="txt_community_code23">CONSEQUENCES</string>
    <string name="txt_community_code24">If you violate the expectations described here, we may restrict your privileges or access to features in our games. Restrictions serve to shield the community from future disruption, and provide an opportunity to reflect on the behavior that led to the restriction. We strive to provide a path to reform, but not at the expense protecting the rest of the community. We also strive to restrict based on the disruption caused, and to avoid action that is needlessly punitive or harsh.\n\n Restrictions for violating the expectations above can include (but are not limited to):\n\n./ Loss of the ability to use in-game communication systems.\n./ Restrictions or additional requirements to access experiences such as Ranked queues.\n./ Restricted access to social systems and features in any of Riot’s games.\n./ Removal of content found to be obtained inappropriately.\n./ Temporary or indefinite suspension from VALORANT, or all of Riot’s games.</string>
